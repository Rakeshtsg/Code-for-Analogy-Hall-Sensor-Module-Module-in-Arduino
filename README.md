# Code-for-Analogy-Hall-Sensor-Module-Module-in-Arduino
An analog Hall effect sensor is a device that uses a magnetic field to measure the position or motion of a magnet or metallic object. The sensor outputs an analog voltage that is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.
In this code, the analog Hall effect sensor is connected to analog pin 0, and the magnetic field strength is calculated by multiplying the sensor's output voltage by 0.0048. This value is then printed to the serial port, so you can view it using the Arduino serial monitor.
